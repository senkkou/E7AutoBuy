# E7AutoBuy

Auto refreshes secret shop and buy all Covenant Bookmarks and Mystic Medals  
  
Get Started:  
1-Install Tesseract OCR https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki  
2-Open config.ini  
3-Make sure tesseractPath is the same you installed tesseract-ocr  
4-Make sure your game is in english  
  
How to use:  
1-In config.ini set the number of refreshes you want the bot to do, the number of skystones spent will be 3 times this value  
2-Delay = 1 is the default speed, if you are using a PC with bad performance try to increase the delay to run it slowly  
3-Use your emulator in full screen and it must be on your main monitor  
4-Finish your dispatch mission or start long ones. (So the window doesnt pop up during shop reroll)
5-Change chat to a empty channel  
6-Start the program  
7-Open secret shop  
8-Confirm program window.  
  
Additional notes:  
By default it will only work if your screen resolution is in presets.ini, by default 1280x720, 1920x1080 and 2560x1080  
if you use any other resolution change to one of the three above or do your own configuration and write in the file.
